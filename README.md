back-end will generate tables automatically, however database with the name "cameracontroller" needs to be created before hand.
## Data
Data for cameras needs to be loaded using postman post request with the data provided [here](https://github.com/OmarA65/controllerApp/blob/main/Camera%20data.txt)
Postman request url: http://localhost:8080/camera/add
## Additional details
There are 15 cameras provided in the data folder. <br />
When adding a camera through post method there is no need to send the following: uid,parentId or dateCreated, these are automatically generated by the back-end. <br />
The application starts with no controllers and can be created using the Add controller button. <br />
Adding a camera previously held by a controller to a new controller will detach the selected cameras from the old controller. <br />
When creating a controller keep in mind the ip has to be unique not only on the scale of controllers but on the scale of cameras as well. <br />
